The island of Manhattan was purchased for beads worth $24 from the Indians. Despite this costly beginning, New York City has been one of the great centers of the arts and culture in the United States. In 1624, it began as New Amsterdam, a Dutch commercial settlement, and transitioned into a British colony in 1664. New York was named in honor of the Duke of York, who was granted the territory by his brother, England's Charles II. It remained a British stronghold until dispossessed following the war of independence. At the end of the 18th century and through the first half of the 19th, New York was the capital city of the United States. 
The southern tip of Manhattan Island and part of what was Long Island belonged to the city of New York since the beginning. However, Brooklyn was entirely autonomous. Two other cities of Long Island - Jamaica, which was Dutch territory until 1664, and Flushing were autonomous but made relatively routine visits to the British Governor to pay their tribute. The present-day borough of Bronx was apparently a sleepy hollow. The borough of Queens was a separate British colony known first as Nassau County, which then became a part of the borough of Queens. The Dutch territories of Staten Island were ruled by the Dutch West India Company. 
The colony fell to the British in 1664, who then lost both the city of New York and the rest of New York to the Dutch from 1673 to 1674. In 1674, the Dutch traded with the English for the territories of New Netherlands, and the name was subsequently changed in 1674 to New York in honor of the Duke of York, who later reigned as England's James II.<br><br>
New York City is known as one of the most culturally diverse cities in America. Unique neighborhoods, foods, and people are a testament to the varied lifestyles and ethnic cultures that are in abundance. Without question, all of these attributes contribute to making the Big Apple one of the greatest, most diverse cities in which to live, work, and play. The following are just a couple of the many examples that pay homage to the diverse cultures that New York City has to offer. One of the earliest and most widely known European cultural groups to settle in New York City was the Dutch. In the early 17th century, the Dutch formed the main
 population of New Amsterdam, now known as New York City. When the English took control of the city in 1664, New York City quickly became the seat of cultural leaders. Taking over from the Dutch, the English provided New York with a well-formed base for their language and established the city as a center for the arts, religion, and education. No enclaves or great numbers of native Dutch New Yorkers exist today with names like Schenectady or Catskill, but the Dutch have left behind an appreciation for imported cheeses, cookies, art, and even tulips. Besides some of the other interesting things to do while in New York, the Dutch have an 
 impact on the city's cultural palaces, the most prominent of all being a 74-acre park in the heart of Manhattan dotted with fountains, gardens, and a respite – Central Park.
